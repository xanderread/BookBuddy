# Book Buddy - Book Recommendation System

Book Buddy is a book recommendation system developed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recommender Systems techniques. This project aims to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences and reading history.

## Overview

The Book Buddy system leverages the power of GNNs to capture the complex relationships between users and books, improving the accuracy and relevance of recommendations. The model is trained on a dataset of book ratings and interactions, learning to predict user preferences for various books.
